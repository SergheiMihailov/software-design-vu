## Object diagrams								
Author(s): Yael Goede

![snapshot Diagram](snapshotDiagram.png)
In the diagram above a snapshot of the system is shown where the database class is filled with 4 snippets. All snippets have a unique id which makes them unique from each other. Further more all fields are filled with the required information, such as the language, tags and content field. 
The content field contains the actual code used as snippet by the user. The language field specifies the programming language which is valid for the content field. This field enables features such as the text highlighting feature, which is language specific.

### Class CLiUI
![snapshot Diagram](cli_stateDiagram.jpeg)

#### States
- Initial State: Here we display the menu and wait for the user input. In event of valid user input, one of the 6 functionalities is executed.
- View all snippets: Lists all snippets and their attributes (title, content, tags, language, metadata)
- Prompt for details [for creation of snippet]: In event of choosing to create a snippet, the user is prompted for a title, the language and tags. A snippet is then created and a editor is opened with no content. 
- Editor mode: The editor loads content if the editor opened a existing snippet, and a blank page otherwise. On exit, the user is prompted to either save the file or not.
- Prompt for ID: In case of deleting or editing a snippet, the user is prompted for the ID of the snippet to be deleted/edited. If the ID is valid the snippet is deleted/opened in the editor.
- View found snippets: In event of filtering, the user can specify parameters for filtering on title name, content or tags and the found snippets are displayed.
- Quit: quit the program	
							
## Sequence diagrams									
Author(s): Milos

This chapter contains the specification of at least 2 UML sequence diagrams of your system, together with a textual description of all its elements. Here you have to focus on specific situations you want to describe. For example, you can describe the interaction of player when performing a key part of the videogame, during a typical execution scenario, in a special case that may happen (e.g., an error situation), when finalizing a fantasy soccer game, etc.

For each sequence diagram you have to provide:
- a title representing the specific situation you want to describe;
- a figure representing the sequence diagram;
- a textual description of all its elements in a narrative manner (you do not need to structure your description into tables in this case). We expect a detailed description of all the interaction partners, their exchanged messages, and the fragments of interaction where they are involved. For each sequence diagram we expect a description of about 300-500 words.

The goal of your sequence diagrams is both descriptive and prescriptive, so put the needed level of detail here, finding the right trade-off between understandability of the models and their precision.

### Sequence diagram for Creating a snippet
![Sequence diagram](SEQDCreateSS.png)
### Description
The user selects create in the Command line interface. After selecting create, the user is prompted 
with 3 reply messages asking for the title, language and tags for the snippet the user wants to create. 
After the user provides this information, the Command line interface calls create() to the snippet 
manager, which will fist call a method called getNextId, which will return the next available
ID the snippet can have. After it has the ID, the snippet manager creates a new instance of a snippet with that ID and the information specified by the user. When a new snippet is constructed, a new file is made and the snippet calls writeSnippetToJson, which is part of the JsonIO class. 
This will write the relevant data for the snippet to the file.
The snippet objects are stored in a hashmap called snippets. 
After a new snippet object is created, the snippet manager adds a new entry to the hashmap, 
containing the ID and created snippet. 
After this is done, the snippet manager will call edit on that snippet, and the user will be able to start writing the contents for their newly created snippet.

### Sequence diagram for Editing a snippet
![Sequence diagram](SEQDEditSS.png)
### Description
When the user choses the edit snippet option from the Command line interface and provided the ID of the snippet he/she wants to edit back to the Cli, the Cli makes a call Edit to the snippet manager class. fist the snippet manager will check if the ID the user provided is valid. If the ID is not valid, an error message will be prompted to the user through the Command line interface. If the ID is valid, the snippet manager will send a message to the snippet that is about to be edited, Edit(snippetToEdit). The snippet will then open an editor. When this instance of the editor
class is constructed, it will grab the content from the snippet the user has selected to edit by calling getContent on the snippet and will display that in the textfield. Now that the editor is open the user can freely edit the contents of the snippet. When the user has edited his/hers snippet and wishes to close 
out of the editor and presses save, the method setContent is called on the snippet
object that‚Äôs currently being edited. This method is responsible for updating the Json snippet‚Äôs content. The argument passed to this method is getFullEditorContent, which returns the current content in the editor. When setContent is called on the snippet object, the snippet calls the method writeToJson, which is part of the JsonIO class. This method updates the Json object so that the changes are actually saved. This JsonIO class is a singleton class that is nice to have, because then the snippet manager doesn‚Äôt have to be responsible for saving snippets, but the snippets can ‚Äúsave themselves‚Äù by using that helper class, which is good for modularity, and will make changing specific details in the way snippets are saved/stored easier to do because of the fact there are less dependencies between classes.

### Sequence diagram for the filter method
![Sequence diagram](SSSEQDFilter.png)
### Description						
The user selects the filter option in the Command line interface. 
The Cli will return a message asking the user to specify filterterms, language, and tags to filter by.
After the user has provided these arguments to the Cli, the Cli then calls Filter() with those parameters to the snippet manager. Filter will return a string object that contains snippets. 
This string is constructed by the listSnippet method. listSnippet will return all snippets in string form, but with the filter method we reduce that to only the snippets that conform to the filter specified by the user. 
This string will be provided back to the Cli, which then prints that string for the user to see.		

# Implementation
Author(s): `Serghei`

In this chapter you will describe the following aspects of your project:
- the strategy that you followed when moving from the UML models to the implementation code;
- the key solutions that you applied when implementing your system (for example, how you implemented the syntax highlighting feature of your code snippet manager, how you manage fantasy soccer matches, etc.);
- the location of the main Java class needed for executing your system in your source code;
- the location of the Jar file for directly executing your system;
- the 30-seconds video showing the execution of your system (you can embed the video directly in your md file on GitHub).

### Strategy
To make sure our implementation is consistent with the presented uml diagrams, we iteratively implemented the features, classes and quality requirements. By using the agile development method our team could track open tasks through the scrumboard available on the github platform.

### Key Solution
To keep us from reinventing the wheel, our implementation tries to use as many external libraries as possible. For example, our dynamic text highlighting feature is implemented using an external syntaxhighlighting library.

### location of the main Java class
_src/main/java/Main.java_

### Location of the Jar file

IMPORTANT: remember that your implementation must be consistent with your UML models. Also, your implementation must run without the need from any other external software or tool. Failing to meet this requirement means 0 points for the implementation part of your project.
